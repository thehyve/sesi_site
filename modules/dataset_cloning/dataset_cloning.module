        // general.
        //
        // The issue:
        //
        // Both search_index and workbench_moderation use delayed processing. Search_api marks nodes to be indexed
        // and then does the actual indexing in a shutdown hook. The workbench_moderation_moderate below first sets
        // the current revision of the variable to unpublished because it thinks that may be an old revision. It
        // then registers a shutdown hook to sets the node revision back to published because workbench_moderation
        // thinks the current version might still be in use for other things and some non-versionable related
        // content may not have been updated yet. (see comments in workbench_moderation_moderate)
        // The result is that the shutdown hook from search_api is run first, and loads the to-be-indexed variable
        // from the db, which still is set to draft and is thus indexed as draft. After that the
        // workbench_moderation shutdown hook sets the variable to published, but then the index is stale and the
        // variable is not marked as change.
        //
        // As a workaround we make sure the variable nodes are loaded into the entity cache here.
        // Workbench_moderation doesn't clear that cache, so search_api will load the nodes from the cache (that
        // contains the published version) instead of the database.
        $variable = node_load($variable->nid);

        if(!empty($options['publish'])) {
            workbench_moderation_moderate($variable, workbench_moderation_state_published());

            // Second workaround: workbench_moderation_moderate changes the database directly, and for nodes that are
            // new and published the edit is wrong, so undo. This workaround is an alternative to the one mentioned
            // above of loading the node into the entity cache. One of them should be sufficient, but I've implemented
            // both just to be sure. The entity cache could be cleared by some other module inadvertently.

    // If the $to_ds object is not in the entity cache, e.g. because it was constructed from a form submit instead of
    // being loaded from the database, the corresponding_node_references module has updated a different copy of the
